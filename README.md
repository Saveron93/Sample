Didn't do any multi-threading since for this task it was unnecessary,
would be weird to squeeze it somewhere just to do multi-threading.


Haven't use IntelliJ and Java in a while, couldn't find how to pack external dependencies to the repo and gradle.


Requires external:

- com_google_code_gson_gson_2_8_6
- hsqldb_hsqldb_1_8_0_10


Simply takes first argument from cmd as an input path, optionally second as output name.
